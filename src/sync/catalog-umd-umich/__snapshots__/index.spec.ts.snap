Field Class: involves international travel and required costs in addition to tuition. This class explores the story behind Caribbean \\"paradise.\\" We use the analytical methods of historical archaeology to \\"read\\" sites of enslavement and resistance, as well as modern museum interpretations of Caribbean heritage, and engage in the production of new archaeological knowledge through excavation. We will ask how negative or \\"dark\\" history should be remembered, what life was like on Caribbean plantations, and how histories of slavery are relevant now. Throughout, we will examine how archaeology can tell the untold stories of the many people-black, white, free, and enslaved-who never made it into the history books. We will also contribute new voices with a \\"mini-field season\\" of archaeological excavation: students can gain a glimpse into scientific archaeology, and get to try out fieldwork to see if they would gain from a full field school.

Do the dead really \\"talk\\" about their lives and how they died? This course is designed as an introductory course for students interested in demystifying and getting to know the real forensic anthropology. Forensic anthropology is a specialized sub-field of biological anthropology that applies many of the methods of biological anthropology to the discovery, excavation, and identification of human remains in a medico-legal context. In this class we learn about the human skeleton and explore the key methods that are used in the identification of individuals, such as age-at-death estimation, sex determination, stature, ancestry, and personal identification. We also deal with assessment of the different types of trauma, and whether or not we can tell the cause and manner of death. The broader ethical roles and responsibilities of forensic anthropologists are also discussed, including discussions of how we determine race/ancestry, as well as ethical responsibilities we have during the investigation of human rights abuses, disasters and criminal inquiries.

Field Class: involves international travel and required costs in addition to tuition. This class explores the story behind Caribbean \\"paradise\\". We use the analytical methods of historical archaeology to \\"read\\" sites of enslavement and resistance, as well as modern museum interpretations of Caribbean heritage, and engage in the production of new archaeological knowledge through excavation. We will ask how negative or \\"dark\\" history should be remembered, what life was like on Caribbean plantations, and how histories of slavery are relevant now. Throughout, we will examine how archaeology can tell the untold stories of the many people-black, white, free, and enslaved-who never made it into the history books. We will also contribute new voices with a \\"mini-field season\\" of archaeological excavation: students can gain a glimpse into scientific archaeology, and get to try out fieldwork to see if they would gain from a full field school.

People have biological requirements for sugar and salt, and these nutrients have important biological impacts on people. At the same time, the need for these nutrients forces people to migrate great distances; create new technology for production, transport, and consumption of foods containing these nutrients; organize and reorganize their social groups; and develop new economic and political organizations. Specific topics will be the rise of colonialism, slavery, global trade, and the anthropology of eating.",

We also examine how art historians apply modern theories of collective and social memory in their scholarship on Roman art, creating new ways of understanding Roman sculpture, painting, and architecture.

We will discuss a wide range of movements, genres, and styles (Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism, Dada, Weimar and Russian photomontage, Soviet film, found footage film, French decollage, postwar assemblage) and their relation to the ever-changing mass media, the urban, and the modernized - in short, the everyday.

The course familiarizes the student with the Astronomical concepts and vocabulary used in other Astronomy courses at the 300-level and beyond.  The course begins with an overview of Astronomical objects and terminology, before introducing conservation laws in Physics and their applications in Astronomy.  Newtonian mechanics and gravity are then introduced and applied to various self-gravitating systems and scenarios.  Electromagnetism, Quantum Mechanics and a small amount of Statistical Physics are covered at sufficient detail to understand the behavior of electromagnetic radiation and thermal emission.  Special and General relativity are introduced from the point of view of understanding the behaviors of certain exotic objects in Astronomy.  Common statistical distributions used in upper-level Astronomy courses are also introduced with an emphasis on application.",

Direct measures using radar ranging and trigonometric parallax will be discussed for objects in the solar system and for stars within about 3000 light-years of the Sun, respectively. For more remote systems in or just outside the Milky Way, methods based spectroscopic parallax and the period-luminosity relation for various types of variable stars will be introduced. For the extra-galactic objects, use of the Hubble relation and the light curves of Type Ia supernovae will be made to assess the distances. At each rung of the ladder, emphasis will be placed on the astrophysical principles and processes underlying the methodology being applied. 3 hours lecture",

Modern cosmology, buttressed by increasingly precise observational data provided by space missions like HST, COBE, and WMAP, teaches that the universe is composed primarily of matter we cannot see nor properly characterize, the so-called 'dark matter,' and of energy whose source is unknown and may defy knowing, the ubiquitous 'dark energy.' This course will attempt to elucidate what we currently understand about the composition, structure and evolution of the universe based on general relativistic theory and astronomical observations of remote galaxies using both ground- and space-based technologies. Special attention will be given to the means by which important cosmological parameters that determine the structure of the universe, like the critical density, the Hubble parameter, and the curvature and cosmological constants, are established. If time permits, additional consideration will be given to the array of planned future space missions devoted to cosmology-related subjects.",

Forensic anthropology is a specialized sub-field of biological anthropology that applies many of the methods of biological anthropology to the discovery, excavation, and identification of human remains in a medico-legal context. In this class we learn about the human skeleton and explore the key methods that are used in the identification of individuals, such as age-at-death estimation, sex determination, stature, ancestry, and personal identification. We also deal with assessment of the different types of trauma, and whether or not we can tell the cause and manner of death. The broader ethical roles and responsibilities of forensic anthropologists are also discussed, including discussions of how we determine race/ancestry, as well as ethical responsibilities we have during the investigation of human rights abuses, disasters and criminal inquiries.

Issues discussed may include the role of culture in criminal defenses, conflicts between religious and secular law, and how race, gender and ethnicity impact engagement with the law as lawyers and as clients. The class addresses anthropological and sociological theories about the nature of law and disputes, examines related studies of legal structure in non-Western cultures, and considers the uses of sociology and anthropology in studying our own legal system. By examining individual legal institutions in the context of their particular cultural settings, students can begin to make cross-cultural comparisons and contrasts. In doing so, the class confronts the challenge of interpreting and understanding the legal rules and institutions of other cultures while assessing the impact of our own social norms and biases.

The course takes the student from the first response on the crime scene to documenting crime scene evidence and preparing evidence for courtroom presentation.  It includes topics such as arson, homicide, suicide, and felony murder.  CRJ 486 examines how the police conduct successful investigations, how the associated crime scene evidence is collected, and how to use the evidence to locate, apprehend, and prosecute the suspect.",

      "description": "This class is a study of the increasing use of scientific evidence in criminal cases, gathered by crime scene investigators (CSI) and/or later developed in a crime laboratory. After a review of the history and development of forensic scientific evidence, the class will study the standards used by courts to prevent the admission of so-called \\"junk science\\" and the emergence of DNA as a new model for forensic science evidence. Several common forms of scientific evidence, beginning with DNA, will be studied, including fingerprints, handwriting, hair, bite marks, ballistics, fire and arson debris, and blood stains. The study also includes the forensic use of social sciences testimony, including the reliability of eyewitness testimony and several forms of abuse \\"syndrome\\" testimony. Each of these forms of evidence will be described and then compared to the \\"junk science\\" standards and to the most recent information about their reliability. The class will examine the impact of forensic science evidence or juroors and the so-called \\"CSI Effect\\". The reaction of courts, attorneys and police to juror expectations for scientific evidence will be reviewed. Finally, the class will review the impact of DNA exonerations and the National Academy of Sciences report on the reliability of forensic science evidence and how judges and appeals courts are responding to those challenges, particularly the current controversies concerning over the validity of such violence.

In this course, we will focus on the substantive and procedural criminal law ('law on the books') while we simultaneously focus on empirical research of enforcement, case processing and sentencing in the criminal justice system (the 'law in action'). As a result, we will assess the relationship and differences between what the criminal law says 'on the books' and the criminal justice system 'in action'.",

This course will analyze different institutions. This will range from colonialism to the mafia to prison gangs to economic development. A significant part of the class will be a spring break trip to Cuba. Before we go we will study the institutional literature on democracies and dictatorships and then spend a week traveling around one of the last communist countries that still exists.",

      "description": "Cost-benefit analysis arguably is the most important tool in evaluating public and private policies. Conceptually, cost-benefit analysis is simple: subtract the costs from the benefits and adopt those policies yielding the greatest net benefit. In practice cost-benefit analysis is much more complicated. Costs and benefits must be summed over time, requiring a calculation of net present value. Costs and benefits must be summed over different people, requiring a social welfare function. Finally costs and benefits must be summed over a variety of goods and services, some of which do not have market values or where market values are not appropriate measures. This course reviews the techniques involved in cost-benefit analysis and employs case studies to illustrate these techniques. (AY)",

Empirically-based behavioral science offers policy makers the opportunity to decrease the impact of psychological limitations of lazy or boundedly rational individuals.  In this course we consider various public policies that are informed by behavioral science research in the areas of retirement savings, household borrowing, health care, energy use and choice of nutrition.

      "description": "This course is a reading intensive seminar on behavioral economics, which is the combination of psychology and economics that investigates what happens in markets in which some agents display human limitations and complications. The course focuses on the behavioral economics theory and its' application to business practice and policy decision making. Specifically, in this course we: (1) examine the ways in which people deviate from the standard economics models, including irrationality, preferences for fairness, propensity to cooperate, trust, dual-interest, empathy and emotions; (2) explore behavioral economics theories and models; (3) discuss how the behavioral economics theories and models can be applied to solve business and policy problems.

This course will provide an overview of the issues related to the diverse group of individuals with developmental disabilities. Topics include the history and public policy issues related to this population. Special consideration will be given to familial issues within the context of socio-cultural issues and the role of families in the provision of services across the lifespan. Students will be exposed to the range of assessment practices for developmental disabilities, including intellectual, adaptive behavior, psychosocial, behavioral, psychoeducational, and developmental. Specific conditions under the category of developmental disabilities are covered, along with the diagnostic criteria for these conditions. Other topics include educational and behavioral interventions, person centered planning/family centered support, post-school and adult issues, physical and mental health issues, services and supports to improve quality of life, controversial therapies, and ethical issues for individuals with developmental disabilities.

This course serves as an elective course for the Semester in Detroit (SiD) program. It is devoted to short fiction in search of a creative rendering of the people in Detroit, a city which offers rich opportunities to explore the theme of the \\"other\\". Students will develop short narratives that capture their impressions of the city through its people. Each student will find Detroiters to \\"study\\" and creatively report on. Class discussions will help direct students. (S)",

It goes beyond a discussion of the relative merits of plays and their respective film adaptions, examining the complex exchanges between the two artistic mediums (e.g. how stage convention such as soliloquies or off-stage action are adapted to the scree; how early silent films were used to market stage productions, etc.). It will approach the issue of adaption by examining the works of key directors, multiple films of a single play, silent films, foreign lanuage adaptions, mass market and art house films, and films which deal with fictive or actual productions of Shakespeare's plays. Special emphasis will be placed on specific stage productions that are later adapted to films. In this course, students will explore a broad range of responses to and interpretations of Shakespeare's works. This class will stress the idea that each staging is an interpretation of the play, its point of view conditioned by the times, the medium, and the director's vision. (OC)",

Students themselves will learn to use language to become more active, well-informed citizens. They will study rhetorical awareness, audience analysis and persuasive writing techniques and put those lessons to use in community settings. They will perform community service at agencies of their choosing and use those experiences as objects of analysis, researching the social context in which those agencies operate and writing analytically about the agencies. Further, students will synthesize classroom lessons and real-world experience by executing writing tasks for and with the agencies (these tasks might include editorials for the local press, informational webpages and fundraising materials).",

Students learn to identify the aesthetic qualities (such as camp, performativity, coded subtexts, homoeroticism, and the relationship between creativity and sexuality), and historical, political, and social concerns that characterize LGBTQ literary and cultural production. Topics covered include the struggle for civil rights before and after Stonewall, coming out narratives, the negotiation of homophobic cultures, post-colonial writers, and memoirs of the LGBTQ experience, as well as the historical emergence of sexual categories and the literary critique of heteronormativity.

This course focuses on the research, planning, and strategies that are critical in the process of pursuing a new venture. Particular focus will be given to the business model and key resources to support the early stages of both large and small ventures. The business model canvas will be used to understand how a venture creates, delivers, and captures value. Students will critically analyze businesses, products, and services and, in a team, they will create their own plan to implement a venture. (YR)",

Specific parks to be visited varies from year to year, enabling the course to be repeated once for credit. Emphasis is placed on taking field  notes, describing rock sequences in outcrop, geologic map reading and aerial photograph interpretation. Special attention is focused on the understanding and development of cratonic sequences, particularly the regional correlation (both lithostratigraphic and time-stratigraphic) of sandstone, shale and limestone facies, and small and large scale geologic features such as folds and faults. Depending on the national park being visited the students may explore paleographic and paleoclimatic evidence from fossils as well as sedimentary structures. This is a field-oriented course requiring a significant amount of physical exertion. (YR)",

Field Class: involves international travel and required costs in addition to tuition. This class explores the story behind Caribbean \\"paradise.\\" We use the analytical methods of historical archaeology to \\"read\\" sites of enslavement and resistance, as well as modern museum interpretations of Caribbean heritage, and engage in the production of new archaeological knowledge through excavation. We will ask how negative or \\"dark\\" history should be remembered, what life was like on Caribbean plantations, and how histories of slavery are relevant now. Throughout, we will examine how archaeology can tell the untold stories of the many people-black, white, free, and enslaved-who never made it into the history books. We will also contribute new voices with a \\"mini-field session\\" of archaeological excavation: students can gain a glimpse into scientific archaeology, and get to try out fieldwork to see if they would gain from a full field school.

The course invites students to reflect on various prison narritives from select European countries. We will investigate how men and women of different races and ethnicities experienced oppression and how they used their bodies and developed skills to remain human in dehumanizing conditions. This provides students with an opportunity to reflect on the circumstances that led to their imprisonment, but also with a way to examine how they narrated their life stories. While doing the course will examine the concept of agency as something that frames life stories. Finally, it will allow students to reflect on various ways individuals in various circumstances struggle to remake their lives inside as well as outside of prison. Various categories, such as gender, art, resistance, body and space will help us navigate through rich primary source material, which includes memoirs, drawings, paintings, and poems created within a constrained space of prisons and camps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The course is part of the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program, which combines a theoretical knowledge with practical understanding and experience by holding class inside Macomb Correctional Facility throughout the semester. The class has roughly equal numbers of UMD students and incarcerated students, and utilizes a variety of active learning techniques, leading to the production of one or more class projects by the end of the course.",

As a seminar, it is intended for advanced concentrators who will research their own specialized topics within the intellectual community of the seminar?providing support and enrichment for the other class members. The general theme for the semester is ?Microhistory.?  Within this general rubric we will be focusing upon three major issues: 1) Microhistory as a tool of historical investigation/analysis [i.e., what is microhistory?], 2) the advantages/disadvantages of this approach to historical inquiry [what can it reveal for us?], and 3) employing the technique to produce a discrete microhistorical study [how do we do it?].  The overall purpose of this micro-level approach is to provide a distinct, readily accessible medium through which to consider broader historical trends.",

Much too often, population health is understood to be either a ?sum? of the health of individuals comprising the population or to be identical with public health. Yet, population health is distinct in its definition, determinants/ risk factors, measurement/evaluation, and strategies for improvement from both individual health and public health. Population health encompasses traditional public health and individual-level preventive medicine but emphasizes the full range of health determinants affecting the entire population rather than only ill or high-risk individuals.",

Special emphasis will be placed on specific stage productions that are later adapted in to films. In this course, students will explore a broad range of responses to and interpretations of Shakespeare's works. The class will stress the idea that each staging is an interpretation of the play, its point of view conditioned by the times, the medium, and the director's vision.",

Students taking this course will develop an understanding of how theory functions as a way to know, understand and change the world. They will also be provided with a lens for comparing the assumptions and implications of alternative theoretical perspectives. A particular emphasis of this course is on theorizing the interrelationships among gender, race, class, sexuality and nationality. Course material includes applications of feminist theory to issues such as gender identity formation; sexuality; gender, law and citizenship; women and work; and the history and politics of social movements.

      "description": "Students in this seminar will explore a collection of extremely short stories-weird and wonderful stories that manage to ignite the imagination and evoke complex realities in just a few pages. Discussion of the stories, guided by provocative questions and thought experiments, will help students develop ways to navigate texts, subtexts, and contexts at a college level; to write more critically and analytically; and to read with more confidence and passion. The seminar will incorporate a series of short, focused writing assignments and some creative research projects. The goal is to discover rich worlds in tiny packages?.and return safely, if somewhat altered, to the real world.",

      "description": "If cities are the centers of human civilization, then why have we inherited such horrific stereotypes of urban environments? This course analyzes how writers (screenwriters, dramatists, urban theories, architects novelists, and poets) tried to reimagine cities (both in America and Britain) as both a unified community of English-speaking individuals and a globalizing model of ?civilized? social organization between 1660 and the present. In doing so, the course argues that our understanding the ?monstrous? connotations of cities depends upon our imagining the simultaneous creation of morally ?angelic? middle-class suburbs in both gothic and horror writing and visual art. Reading may include Dracula, Journal of a Plague Year, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Linden Hills, and The Jungle.",

      "description": "The course is based on a recent book by Daniel Kahneman, entitled \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\". The book is based on the premise that the human brain supports two different modes of thought: (a) a largely unconscious mode that is capable of processing large amounts of information quite quickly, and (b) a slower mode that operates more on the basis of logic.  The goals of the course would be to (a) make sure students understand these two modes and the accompanying data and rationale that support the two modes, (b) understand and be able to apply the fairly simple methodology that underlies many of the related experiments, (c) improve one's own thinking by learning when to rely on each of the two systems and how to avoid the pitfalls associated with each, and (d) be able to extend the literature by performing novel follow-up experiments based on those already performed.",

      "description": "This course analyzes American culture through the lens of its horror industry: in film, literature, art, and other forms of artistic and popular culture. Horror, because of its nature as an extreme form of representation and its association with the imagination rather than reality, has the ability to reveal certain truths and theories about history, culture, and ways of being that are difficult to access through other modes of expression. This course explores these truths and theories by studying American horrors in a way that contextualizes film, stories, art, and other forms of popular culture within particular social, political, and historical moments. Examples include: Cold War horror productions (the short stories of H.P. Lovecraft and Richard Matheson) and the use of aliens and other invaders as a stand in for outsiders and ?others,? domestic horrors like The Nightmare on Elm Street and Beloved and the ways in which violence, gender, race and the home intersect, and a study of post-feminist heroines in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Pretty Little Liars.",

By examining the various ways in which nonhuman animals are objectified in their relationship to humans through religious teachings, portrayed in the media sometimes anthropomorphically, and the ways in which humans make use of animals, students will engage in their own academic inquiry leading to in-depth class discussions about the concept of what it means to be a human and a nonhuman animal.  These investigations and discussions will be based on readings and other sources to guide students? understanding of their own and other?s attitudes to human and nonhuman animals within societies and cross-culturally.",

Have you ever thought that life would be easier if you had been born a different person? This course examines the stories of boundary crossers: individuals who acted on that desire and 'passed' for a member of a different social group. People who have lived on both sides of a social identity offer a unique opportunity to understand the meaning of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation in American society. Their experiences can help us understand social categories and how they have changed over the course of history. What, for example can a person who lived as both a woman and a man tell us about the significance of gender in our society? (OC)",

Their participation, however, was not unfettered. Laws, social mores, familial and religious restraints, etiquette, the threat of violence, lack of funds, and other factors influenced and restricted women?s behavior when in public and structured society?s reactions to their presence. This course will consider the development of these codes of behavior (formal and informal), how women of different ethnicities, races, sexual orientations, and classes experienced their effects, and the ways in which women sought to temper and undermine the system, particularly in the twentieth century. The course will provide an interdisciplinary approach to historic, social, physical, economic, and cultural geographies through which women have traveled.

Particular attention will be given to the gendered history of working through the National Socialist past, the division and reconstruction of the two nation-states, and the terrorism in West Germany in the 1970's. Students will examine images of women in films and tie them to the ideologies of gender and status of women in these larger issues of German history. Course readings will be in English. Students wishing to receive German credit for the course must enroll concurrently in GER 380: Praktikum. Students cannot receive credit for both MCL 401 and MCL 501.",

The course deals with women in European \\"art music\\" traditions and also in jazz and poplar music. Social and cultural norms dictating appropriate female involvement with music are examined. The historical approach will serve to reveal ways in which terms such as professionalism and virtuosity have continually shifted and changed in reference to female musical performance. The course challenges students to re-think many of the commonly accepted gender-based descriptions of particular genres and elements of music through listening and musical analysis.",

An inquiry-based physical science course suitable for prospective or practicing elementary teachers majoring or minoring in science studies. Students will construct meaningful understanding of physics and chemistry concepts through discussion, hands-on experiences and computer simulations. Specific topics will include the application of the atomic model to the behavior of gases, physical changes, and chemical changes. A learning-cycle pedagogy will be employed that consists of elicitation of initial student ideas, development of new or modified ideas, building student consensus on final ideas, and the application of ideas to new situations (F, W, S).",

We will look at what some famous Christian, Muslim and Jewish philosophers, such as Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Peter Abelard, Al-Ghazali, Ibn Rushd, Saadia, Maimonides, Aquinas, Scotus and Ockham had to say about a diverse range of philosophical issues and topics, including the existence and nature of God, free will, morality, reason and revelation, human nature and the problem of universals.

For example, one central question of philosophy; \\"What can we know with certainty?\\" has been transformed through a feminist lens and reinterpreted as \\"What does one's gender, social location, and cultural framework contribute to what one knows?\\"  In this course we will look at the variety of feminist philosophical theories with a focus on epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics.",

Students will spend a week observing a primate species (for example, one possible site for this field course may be to observe free-ranging lemurs at a reserve in Florida).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Student?s data collection at the field site will be for five continuous days.  This field course provides a unique opportunity to study rare and endangered primates species in a safe and accessible environment.  Short day trips to other facilities are possible, such as a visit to an ape sanctuary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Topics covered in this field course include advanced observational methods stemming from the field of Ethology, practical development of ethograms (checksheets) and research design, best practices in GPS data collection methods, and collating and summarizing data on animal behavior into a research paper.  Lecture topics will address ethological methods and research design and also how to conduct research with free-ranging nonhuman primates.  In addition there will be a strong focus on health and safety precautions in the field for human and nonhuman primates, acclimation to the field site, and practicalities of data collection.

This course will examine the continuing evolution of the medical profession, from low status craft in the 19th Century, to high status profession in the middle of the 20th Century, to beleaguered interest group in the 1990's. What has occurred both within and outside the profession to bring about these changes? What is the condition of the medical profession today and what organizational changes does it face in the future? Among the special topics addressed will be how the profession regulates itself and 'guarantees' quality of medical care, and how pressures for cost containment impact medical practice. These are the central issues of the 1990's.",

This course serves as an elective course for the Semester in Detroit (SiD) program. This course looks at movements, resistance, resilience, and liberation as it pertains to environmental justice. A growing body of evidence reveals that people of color and low-income persons have borne greater environmental and health risks than the society at large in their neighborhood, workplace, and playgrounds. We will connect history, current events, and real-life experiences to local organizing and movement struggles that build power for our communities. We will utilize highly interactive popular education methods where participants share political analysis, learn facilitation and organizing skills, and think together about long-term, transformative strategies to build environmental, racial and economic justice.",

This course serves as a core course for the Semester in Detroit (SiD) program. The primary purpose of this class is to provide a supportive, yet challenging learning space for reflecting on your Detroit internship experiences this semester. There are three main sources of material for this class: you, the internship, and Detroit. While, in theory, each is distinct, in practice, all three are interwined and interact and affect one another. Your challenge will be learning to see more clearly the interactions among these domains. Students must apply to, and be accepted by UM-Ann Arbor's Semester in Detroit program to enroll in this course.",

This course will provide students with the basic skill set needed to handle such data. The course will focus on three broad areas- inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-word applications. We will discuss data collection, data cleaning and exploratory analysis of data so that students can connect the data to the underlying phenomena and be able to think critically about the conclusions that are drawn from the data analysis. The students will also learn how to write short programs to be able to automate the data analysis process developing an applied understanding of different analytics methods, including linear regression, logistic regression, clustering, data visualization, etc. Most of the material will be taught using real world data.

The bulk of the course will focus on the late 19th and 20th century urban environment with an eye towards understanding the diverse residents, cultures, economies, and geographies that have shaped the American cities. We will cover everything from developments in transportation, architecture, business, and technology to immigration, politics, and urban culture. Broad concerns and constituencies have shaped the urban public sphere, the physical development of cities and the experiences of living as an urbanite and, consequently, they will receive much of our attention. American patterns of development will then be placed in context with those of other nations and cultures.",

We also examine LGBTQ journeys within Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, new spiritual movements, and interfaith work. Assignments create room for students to engage faith traditions that are not covered in the course readings. The course highlights intersections at three levels of analysis: the individual or personal level (how do LGBTQ identities intersect and interact with religious freedom and practice?), the interactional or community level (how do LGBTQ people experience belonging and rejection in diverse faith communities?), and the institutional level (how do the structures of these belief systems shape the life chances of LGBTQ people in society?).

Italian authors studied include three very influential Florentines, Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, as well as Castiglione and Asiosto. We will read women poets, patrons, prostitutes and queens from Italy and France such as Veronica Gambara, Isabella di Morra, Vittoria Colonna, Christine de Pizan, Louise Labe and Marguerite de Navarre. At issue will be women's roles and women's images in city and court culture during the early modern period and the interaction of their writings with the literary canons of Italy and France.",

Understanding women?s reproductive health requires consideration of the intersections of gender, race, class, culture, geography, economic status, and nation within a sociopolitical context.  The course introduces students to the historical trends in the regulation of women?s fertility and reproductive health.  Readings draw from a number of different disciplines, including: law, medical studies, history, social sciences, and personal narratives to critically examine the intent and impact of current standards for reproductive health policy and practice.  Topics include: reproductive justice, contraception, pregnancy, reproductive control, and family leave.  Course discussions include a focus on health policy and activism to affect change related to women?s reproductive health, all within a framework of reproductive justice.  A major emphasis is on developing critical thinking skills that can be applied to issues of women?s reproductive health in order to educate and empower students to become proactive healthcare consumers.",

By studying the self-representation and culturally unique perspective of this emerging canon of writers, students in this course understand the emergence of LGBTQ literary traditions and understand the cultural diversity within these traditions. Students learn to identify the aesthetic qualities (such as camp, performativity, coded subtexts, homoeroticism, and the relationship between creativity and sexuality), and historical, political, and social concerns that characterize LGBTQ literary and cultural production. Topics covered include the struggle for civil rights before and after Stonewall, coming out narratives, the negotiation of homophobic cultures, post-colonial writers, and memoirs of the LGBTQ experience, as well as the historical emergence of sexual categories and the literary critique of heteronormativity. This course counts toward the English discipline diversity requirement. Students cannot receive credit for WGST 471 and WGST/ ENGL 571.",

The course argues that by tracing the gothic?s literary history, we may simultaneously witness a history of gender formation. Readings may include English novelists who originated a gothic style in English (Walpole, Radcliffe, Lewis) as well as English and American poets and novelists who have debated as well as resisted the effects of the gothic on readers? (particularly women?s) psychology (Christina Rossetti, Austen, King, Stoker).",
