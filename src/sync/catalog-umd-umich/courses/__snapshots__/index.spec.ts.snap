This course is conducted as a guided project design course over a two semester period, with the class divided into teams, each assigned a specific design project. Periodic progress reports, a final written report, an oral presentation and project demonstration are required. Cost analysis, societal impact, safety issues, evaluation of design alternatives and application of engineering principles will be emphasized.",

This course is conducted as a guided project design course over a two semester period, with the class divided into teams, each assigned a specific design project. Periodic progress reports, a final written report, an oral presentation and project demonstration are required. Cost analysis, societal impact, safety issues, evaluation of design alternatives and application of engineering principles will be emphasized.",
